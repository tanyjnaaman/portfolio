Last year, I spent half a year in Zurich at ETH, and in the second class of Ryan Cotterell's excellent [Large Language Models](https://rycolab.io/classes/llm-s23/) course I walked up to him to ask if he was looking for research assistants. 
It has since been a year with several ups and downs, but today, we (meaning myself, [Josef Valvoda](https://valvoda.github.io/), [Tianyu Liu](https://rycolab.io/authors/tianyu/), [Anej Svete](https://anejsvete.github.io/) and [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/)) put up a paper on arXiv, titled somewhat dramatically "A Fundamental Tradeoff in Aligned Language Models and its Relationship to Sampling Adaptors". 
You can find it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10203).
