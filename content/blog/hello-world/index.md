## A new website

About a year and a half ago, at the start of my second application cycle, I figured I'd build a website for myself. Why? Honestly, I'm not sure. I feel like it was mostly to soothe my anxieties about "not being competitive" in applying for jobs, and somehow I thought a website might give me a better chance of looking more employable.

It makes no difference, as I would find, but I do like the idea of having a place to dump my professional/academic journey. Somehow having a place I have absolute control over without the noise that comes with a platform like LinkedIn appeals to me. So here we are. This version of my website feels much cleaner, less flashy, and it feels more me. I like it.

## Including blogs

Just before I built my previous website, though, I started a private blog. While that's a place for my own personal thoughts and reflections on my journey (and at times, to mope, lol), I've also been thinking for a while to put my reflections and thoughts on the parts of me I'm willing to put _out there_, in part just because I like to, but in part also because I think I've read a lot of others' blogs, and many of them have given me new insights, and just as many have given me a sense of solace in knowing I'm not alone going through some of the experiences we share. But most of all, just as I wrote in the first post of my private blog, I like writing. I write a lot better than I speak, and I get a lot more out of my head when I write - and in a much more coherent fashion.

So I now have a blog, I guess. Hopefully, it's not just noise. I do think it'll be like therapy for me, though, lol.
